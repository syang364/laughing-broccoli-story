Mr. Broccoli is a grumpy man who seldom laughs. He is stubby and has big, green wild-curl up that makes him look like a funky green flower when seen from a distance. 
His eyebrows are locked for the most time and his expression always looks serious. One day, Mr. Broccoli goes to the Kesington Market to do some grocery shopping. It 
is raining heavily and Mr. Broccoli has to hold a big umbrella overhead, which could hardly cover all his voluminous hair.

Thankfully he had a helpful friend, Mrs. Carrot. She was tall, lean and with orange skin glistening from the splash of rain droplets.
She was turning around the corner, with her heels clickity clackin again the wet concrete. She bumped in to Mr. Broccoli.
"Oh dear me! Oh my, oh my, oh my", she exclaimed loudly with a Southern flair, looking up and down judging Mr. Broccoli's predicament.
"HA!, that's what you get for being so horrid to me the other day." smirking as she walked away.

Unfortunately for Mr. Broccoli, he did not manage to keep all of the water off of his hair. The water made him begin to grow even larger. Now he definitely doesn't fit underneath the umbrella. He kept growing, spiraling out of control. 

One day Mr. Broccoli started growing. Pretty soon, Mr. Broccoli was a tree. He grew to be the biggest tree in the forest. However, one day a lumberjack came and chopped Mr. Broccoli down. 

Then Mr. Broccoli became the biggest Christmans tree in the world. He was so big that it took 12 semis to pull him into the city.

On Christmas eve, Mrs. Carrot came to see the biggest tree in the world, and she recognized Mr. Broccoli. "Oh my oh my oh my dear!" Mrs. Carrot exclaimed, "Look at you! What happened, my friend?!" Unfortunately poor Mr. Broccoli cannot not speak anymore, nor could he make any kind of responses to his old friend.
