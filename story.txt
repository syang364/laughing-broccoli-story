Mr. Broccoli is a grumpy man who seldom laughs. He is stubby and has big, green wild-curl up that makes him look like a funky green flower when seen from a distance. 
His eyebrows are locked for the most time and his expression always looks serious. One day, Mr. Broccoli goes to the Kesington Market to do some grocery shopping. It 
is raining heavily and Mr. Broccoli has to hold a big umbrella overhead, which could hardly cover all his voluminous hair.
